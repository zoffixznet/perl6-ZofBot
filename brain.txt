In other they may change slightly or but the expectation is that they are to the final shape of Perl the past the Synopses have often been referred to as formal Perl 6 and but this usage is being deprecated in favor of treating tests from the test suite as official specifications.
This is consistent with Synopsis which says 6 is anything that passes the official test Read Note that documents marked DRAFT are really just that.
They are often written by random and may be speculative as much or more than The documents here mostly correspond with the chapters in the Camel that a few chapters of that book will no longer be and those numbers will be resused for other things.
